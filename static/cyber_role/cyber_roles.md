## Raising the atomic shield; how nuclear is cyberprotected
Securing a nuclear power plant from cyber threats is an ongoing process that requires a combination of technical measures, strong policies, and a dedicated and well-trained security team to ensure the safety and reliability of such critical infrastructure.
Much like a medieval warrior would defend a castle, cybersecurity defenders use three main elements to defend against possible cyberattacks: the brains, the shield and the sword.
### Planning ahead: the brain
Having a methodical approach and a structured mind is key to suceed as a cybersecurity expert. A warrior must not only know how to use the sword and the shield, but also some basic first aid and, above all, he must know that he's not a savage, but a martial artist.
In this analogy, the way of the warrior teaches us that we must have a plan: everything a cyberdefender must do must ensure compliance with cybersecurity laws, regulations and standards. Some examples would be the NIST framework, the IAEA guidelines (nuclear) or other regulations such as NEWRC or CIP.
Security must be methodical, thus following comprehensive security policies and procedures: strict control over the use of removable media, email... everything.
And don't forget the bandages: every Cybersecurity team must have an Incident Response Plan to figure out what to do in the case you do get hacked. Plan the reaction: communication, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
### Going unharmed: the shield
A cyberdefender must have the sturdiest shield it can have, even more so when it comes to nuclear.
Making sure the defense is airtight is key to protect vital infrastructure such as nuclear plants. For that, many practices and tools are utilised:
1.  Physical Security: Nuclear power plants are physically secured due to the dangerous physical access could pose. But on top of that, physical access could also allow exploitation of digital vulnerabilities, which is why nuclear plants are one of the most inaccessible places on the planet. Air-gapping (physical isolation of critical systems) is also done.
2.  Access Control: Ensure strict access controls and implement strong authentication methods to limit physical and logical access to critical systems and sensitive areas. This may involve biometric access, smart cards, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3.  Network Segmentation: Implement a robust network segmentation strategy to isolate critical systems from less critical ones. This helps contain potential breaches and prevent lateral movement by attackers.
4.  SIEM and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Deploy SIEM and IDPS and security monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities, including potential breaches and anomalies within the network.
5.  Patch Management: Maintain a rigorous and well-documented patch management process to ensure that all software and hardware are up to date with security patches and updates.
6.  Security Culture & Awareness Training: Train employees and contractors on cybersecurity best practices and ensure they understand their role in maintaining the security of the facility. Promote a culture of security and zero-trust towards cybercrime.
### Making sure it works: the sword
One does not become a great warrior sparring only against the target dummy with his shield. He must improve his skills with the sword as well, so he may know where his opponnents will attempt to strike. An experienced warrior can also spar with another veteran so he may learn the attacking techniques that he may have to defend against.
This is why the role of the Red Team is also crucial. When defending nuclear powerplants (or most other sectors), these are a few of the tools and practices used:
1.  Security Audits and Pentesting: It's important to conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security infrastructure.
2. Threat Intelligence: Stay informed about the latest cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques specifically targeting critical infrastructure, as well as general cybersecurity threats. This includes collaborating with  relevant government agencies for threat intelligence sharing.
3.  International Collaboration: Consider international cooperation and information sharing with other nuclear facilities and government agencies to enhance overall security.
## The brains, the shield, the sword.
Everything together makes for a solid comprehension of the role of a cyberdefender in the nuclear sector. Understanding the importance of the job and everything that surrounds it is critical  to protect this potentially very dangerous infrastructure. Nowadays, we still need nuclear to live the prosperous lives we lead, but we must also take care that the technology doesn't become a source of problems.
