# Introduction

**The nuclear industry plays a vital role in providing energy to power the modern world, encompassing a diverse spectrum of elements within civilian nuclear infrastructure. From the generation of electricity for widespread consumption to the utilization of medical isotopes in the treatment of cancer patients, the nuclear industry touches upon various facets of our daily lives. It includes a multitude of components, ranging from nuclear power plants and research and testing reactors to facilities involved in the fuel cycle, the management of radioactive waste, and the decommissioning of reactors. Furthermore, it involves the handling of nuclear and radioactive materials in medical, industrial, and educational contexts, and even extends to the transportation of nuclear materials.**

**Our research primarily focuses on nuclear energy centrals, more commonly known as nuclear power plants, which represent a quintessential example of critical infrastructure. These sophisticated facilities harness the immense power of nuclear reactions to efficiently and sustainably generate vast amounts of energy. However, this pivotal role also renders them susceptible to a unique set of challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. The digitalization and interconnectedness of nuclear energy plants have introduced vulnerabilities that necessitate meticulous safeguarding.**

**In this research, we will try to explore the cybersecurity threats they face, implications of cyber attacks to nuclear energy plants.**
