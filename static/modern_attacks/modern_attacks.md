In cybersecurity, an **_attack vector_** is a path or means by which an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a computer, network, or information infrastructure to deliver a payload or malicious outcome. Attack vectors allow attackers to exploit system vulnerabilities, install different types of malware and launch cyber-attacks. There are also many different attack vectors that attackers can effectively exploit to gain unauthorized access to IT infrastructure.

Cyber-attacks on the nuclear sector infrastructure and assets by terrorists, extremists, or foreign actors can target the industrial control systems or SCADA. Attacks may pose a significant threat to the sector, allowing malicious actors to manipulate or exploit facility operations. Cyber-attacks on nuclear power plants could have physical effects, especially if the network that runs the machines and software controlling the nuclear reactor are compromised. This can be used to facilitate sabotage, theft of nuclear materials, or in the worst-case scenario a reactor meltdown.

The most common attack vectors of cyber-attacks are among others:
