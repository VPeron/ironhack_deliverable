#2.2. Motivations behind cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure 
Critical infrastructure, including nuclear energy plants, plays a pivotal role in a nation's security and economic stability. In an increasingly interconnected world, these facilities are becoming attractive targets for cyber-attacks. While the motives for such attacks can vary widely, the motivations driving cyber attacks against critical infrastructures can be categorized under three main titles. 

##State-Sponsored Espionage

Cyber espionage involves obtaining secret information for political, military, or economic gain through illicit internet, network, or computer techniques. It includes:

###A.Geopolitical Gains: Nation-states engage in cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure to gain strategic advantages, such as intelligence on a rival nation's capabilities and intentions.

###B.Intellectual Property Theft: Adversaries may target proprietary technologies and trade secrets, like advanced reactor designs in the context of nuclear energy.

###C.Sabotage and Disruption: State-sponsored actors aim to disrupt nuclear energy plants or cause subtle damage for covert influence.

###D.Cyber Warfare: This is an act of war using internet-enabled technology on a nation's digital infrastructure, typically in the context of a state of war.

##Non-State Actors (Cyber-Terrorism and Hacktivism)

Non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations and hacktivists, target critical infrastructure for ideological and financial motives. It includes:

###A.Ideological Motives: These actors aim to advance their agendas by opposing nuclear energy for moral, political, or environmental reasons.

###B.Financial Gain: Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure for financial gain, often through ransomware attacks.

##Insider Threats

Insider threats come from employees with access to critical infrastructure. Their motivations include personal grievances, financial incentives, coercion, and blackmail. Insider threats are a multifaceted concern.
