The term "critical infrastructure" lacks a universally accepted definition. However, there is a consistent thread running through various interpretations. This common thread underscores the immense societal importance of critical infrastructure and the chaos it can unleash when disrupted. A recurring theme in these interpretations is the complexity of critical infrastructure, highlighting the necessity of examining interdependencies and the potential for widespread failures—a topic of significant societal relevance.

In essence, critical infrastructure encompasses the essential systems, assets, and facilities that underpin the functioning of a nation's society and economy. The disruption or destruction of these elements can result in profound and debilitating consequences for a country's security, public safety, or economic stability. The specific sectors considered critical infrastructure may vary from one country to another, encompassing a wide range of areas.

**In the United States**, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) holds authority over the definition and categorization of critical infrastructure. The DHS identifies and classifies 16 critical infrastructure sectors, each of which plays a pivotal role in the nation's security, public safety, and economic well-being.

1. Chemical Sector
2. Commercial Facilities Sector
3. Communications Sector
4. Critical Manufacturing Sector
5. Dams Sector
6. Defense Industrial Base Sector
7. Emergency Services Sector
8. Energy Sector
9. Financial Services Sector
10. Food and Agriculture Sector
11. Government Facilities Sector
12. Healthcare and Public Health Sector
13. Information Technology Sector
14. Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector
15. Transportation Systems Sector
16. Water and Wastewater Systems Sector

On the other hand **in the European Union**, the definition and protection of critical infrastructure are primarily 
the responsibility of individual member states, although a common framework for European Critical Infrastructure (ECI) 
protection exists. The framework governing Critical Infrastructures in Europe is regulated by the European Directive 2022/2557 
(**The Critical Entities Resilience Directive** - CER Directive). Under this directive 11 sectors are covered⁴. 

1. Energy Sector
2. Transport Sector
3. Banking and Financial Market Infrastructures Sector
4. Health Sector
5. Drinking Water Sector
6. Wastewater Sector
7. Digital Infrastructure Sector
8. Public Administration Entities
9. Space Operations
10. Production, Processing, and Distribution of Food

Each of these sectors confronts its own unique challenges and threats, including the ever-present specter of cybersecurity risks.  

In our research, we will focus on the energy sector, a pivotal component of critical infrastructure, to provide a general overview 
and gain insights into its cybersecurity challenges.We have chosen the nuclear energy plants as a case study within critical 
infrastructure to gain specific insights into its cybersecurity challenges. 

## Nuclear Energy Centrals as Critical Infrastructures

Nuclear energy centrals, commonly known as nuclear power plants, represent an essential example of critical infrastructures 
due to their pivotal role in providing electricity to countless communities worldwide. These sophisticated facilities harness 
the immense power of nuclear reactions to generate vast amounts of energy efficiently and sustainably. 

However, this critical role also makes them susceptible to a unique set of challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. 
The digitalization and interconnectedness of nuclear energy plants introduce vulnerabilities that demand meticulous safeguarding. 
In this exploration, we try to explore the cybersecurity threats they face, implications of cyber attacks to nuclear energy plants .
